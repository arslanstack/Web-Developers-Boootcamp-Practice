    <h1>CuttleFish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine <a href="#">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in
        mass.[3]

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an
        unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia.</p>
    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities
        between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution.</p>
    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein
        haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.
        The blood is pumped by three separate hearts.</p>
